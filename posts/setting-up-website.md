Recently, IOWAGANG was pouring over friends' web blogs when we decided that the time was ripe for us to create our own. Being the only one who takes initiative around here, I started learning about static-site generators. I don't have any prior knowledge in HTML, CSS, or JS, so I was diving into this pretty blind. Here, I am going to try to document my process from start to finish on how to get a public website up on the Internet.

Note: All of the resources mentioned are free, except for the optional custom domain name.

## Using a static-site generator

There are a lot of ways to build a website. But for a simple, mainly text-oriented site, using a static-site generator is the way to go. These generators take in some Markdown files and return a static HTML, CSS, or JS file that can be directly uploaded onto the web.

For my site, I chose to use Eleventy
